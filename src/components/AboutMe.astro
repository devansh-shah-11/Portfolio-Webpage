      I am <strong>Devansh Shah</strong>, an AI researcher and machine-learning engineer. My work spans LLM security and red-teaming, multilingual speech & translation pipelines (Gujarati focus), and applied computer-vision solutions for real-world problems. I build end-to-end systems — from dataset curation and model design to deployment and user-centred evaluation. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

    <p>
      Motivated by <strong>seva (selfless service)</strong>, I focus on projects that deliver measurable community impact: accessible speech tools, low-resource language models, and practical ML for civic problems. My SoP and personal history highlight a mix of research ambition and service-oriented engineering.

      I’m joining the MS Computer Science program at <strong>NYU Courant (Fall 2025)</strong>, where I plan to further my research on model safety, efficient retrieval architectures, and inclusive language technologies. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}
